Initial proof-of-concepts
OK Control MOSFET over TX
-- Read switch over RX
-- Over-the-air update
-- Talk to BME280E
-- Read light
OK Make display work

Verify once parts are there
-- Receive 433MHz (inverted pin!)
-- Control backlight

More to order:
-- Resistors
-- 12V power socket

Dev while PCB manufactured:
-- Station UI and logic loop
-- WiFi access point server
-- WiFi client server; update from URL

When PCB there:
-- Build electronics
-- Design and cut layered plexi frame
